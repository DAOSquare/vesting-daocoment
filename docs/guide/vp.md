## About Vesting

The Vesting module realizes the release link of the projectâ€™s token in the incubator, which can help the project distribute tokens to investors more flexibly and safely according to the release rules stipulated in the protocol. 

## How to Participate in Vesting?

From April 14-May 14, 2022, we kicked off an open beta test of the Vesting module, during which any community member with a Passport or Cafeteria NFT could participate.
